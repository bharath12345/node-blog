        li I love non-fiction. And even if they are fictional, I love movies that leave me feeling better about the world and myself - uplifting sortâ€¦
        li The order below is completely random. By no means can I rank them.
        li These are the movies that I dont mind watching again after every few years... (there are other movies like Batman that I have liked but I dont carry a strong urge to see them again)
        li I do not have a liking for slapstick comedy or horror
